/**
 * Trackable QR redirect.
 *
 * Printed QR codes point at `https://www.rawlinsic.com/go/<slug>`. This route
 * looks the slug up below, tags the destination with UTM params so Vercel Web
 * Analytics attributes the visit to the QR, and issues a temporary redirect.
 *
 * TO RE-POINT A PRINTED QR CODE: edit the destination in DESTINATIONS below and
 * deploy. The printed code never changes. The redirect is 307 + no-store, so
 * nothing caches the old target — the next scan gets the new destination.
 *
 * TO ADD A NEW CODE: add a line here, deploy, then generate a QR for
 * https://www.rawlinsic.com/go/<your-slug>.
 *
 * Note: /rc/[slug] is a separate, older QR redirect map that does not add UTM
 * tagging. Codes printed against /rc/... still work; new trackable codes should
 * use /go/... instead.
